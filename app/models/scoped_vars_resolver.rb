#
# This class recursively crawls the content path
# starting the the current template paths folder and
# traversing each parent folder. Along the way it collects
# the configs specified in each folder and applies then to the
# vars instance variable, then recursively
# calls itself with the parent folders path creating a
# tree of scoped var resolvers along the way by loading
# the config.yml file from the current folder.
#
# Method missing is used to recursively call the parent objects
# looking for a var attribute containing the desired variable
# until the request variable is found on the tree or we hit the bottom
# of the tree.
